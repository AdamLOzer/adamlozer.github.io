    "section": "",
    "text": "Since last autumn, I have been building The UK MP Inbox as part of Verian’s broader initiative to further develop our context modelling capabilities. Inspired by the American DC Inbox and the fantastic work done by Dr. Lindsey Cormack, I sought to build a full, consistently updated, free-to-use database of every official email newsletter sent by UK Members of Parliament. These e-newsletters can be used in wide variety of social science research, providing important context about political messaging, policy-making, and the relevant political zeitgeist.\nUnfortunately, there is much work to be done before the MP Inbox is read for a public launch. However, I plan to post semi-regular updates on the Inbox’s progress, culminating in its full launch (hopefully) prior to the looming UK General Election. The Inbox has already collected thousands of e-newsletters since late November of 2023, with more coming in each and every day. I’m excited to walk you through the basic reasoning behind the project, as well as provide a sneak peak at the patterns in the data collected thus far."
